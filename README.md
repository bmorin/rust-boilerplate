# rust-boilerplate
Boilerplate starter for a Rust + Tokio service

Includes:
* Configuration via Command Line + Environmnt Variables and TOML file
* Tracing set-up with console and file logging
* TOML file watcher to reload configuration
* Systemd health checks

The intention is to use this as a "Hello World" and remove + modify as needed.
